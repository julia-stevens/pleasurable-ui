        <h2>A Global Partnership</h2>
        <p>
            Partnership is essential for sharing information about different types of cancer because it promotes collaboration among researchers, healthcare professionals, and institutions worldwide. By working together, they can pool knowledge, compare findings, and develop a more comprehensive understanding of cancer.
            This collaboration leads to faster breakthroughs in treatment, earlier diagnosis, and more effective prevention strategies. Furthermore, partnerships help reduce duplication of effort and ensure that valuable data and insights are accessible to everyone involved in cancer care and research, ultimately improving outcomes for patients globally.

        <h2>The contourings</h2>
        <p>
            Contouring is a crucial step in radiation therapy planning. It involves outlining the tumor and surrounding healthy tissues on medical images, such as CT or MRI scans. This helps doctors target the cancer accurately while protecting nearby organs.
            Precise contouring ensures that the radiation dose is delivered exactly where it's needed, reducing side effects and improving treatment outcomes. It requires teamwork between radiation oncologists, radiologists, and medical physicists.
            Thanks to advanced imaging and software, contouring has become more accurate, helping patients receive safer and more effective cancer treatment.
