        <div class="home-partners-postion">
            <p>
                Partnership is essential for sharing information about different types of cancer because it promotes collaboration among researchers, healthcare professionals, and institutions worldwide. By working together, they can pool knowledge, compare findings, and develop a more comprehensive understanding of cancer.
                This collaboration leads to faster breakthroughs in treatment, earlier diagnosis, and more effective prevention strategies. Furthermore, partnerships help reduce duplication of effort and ensure that valuable data and insights are accessible to everyone involved in cancer care and research, ultimately improving outcomes for patients globally.

            <p>
                Webinars have become an essential tool for learning, communication, and collaboration. They allow people from around the world to connect in real-time, share knowledge, and engage with expertsâ€”without the need for travel.
                One of the main benefits of webinars is accessibility. Participants can join from any location, making it easier for organizations to reach a broader audience. Webinars are also cost-effective, saving time and money for both hosts and attendees.
                In addition, webinars often include interactive features like Q&A sessions, polls, and chat functions, which encourage active participation and enhance the learning experience.

            <h2>The contourings</h2>
            <p>
                Contouring is a crucial step in radiation therapy planning. It involves outlining the tumor and surrounding healthy tissues on medical images, such as CT or MRI scans. This helps doctors target the cancer accurately while protecting nearby organs.
                Precise contouring ensures that the radiation dose is delivered exactly where it's needed, reducing side effects and improving treatment outcomes. It requires teamwork between radiation oncologists, radiologists, and medical physicists.
                Thanks to advanced imaging and software, contouring has become more accurate, helping patients receive safer and more effective cancer treatment.
